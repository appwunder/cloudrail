Current Status

  ✅ Completed:
  - Authentication system (sign up, sign in, logout)
  - Landing page at root
  - Dashboard routing to /dashboard
  - AWS Accounts management (fully functional)

  Areas That Need Work

  Based on the exploration, here are the next priorities:

  1. Recommendations Page (Currently a Placeholder)

  - The recommendations page exists but has minimal functionality
  - Should show cost optimization suggestions from the backend
  - Could display potential savings, severity levels, and actionable recommendations

  2. Dashboard Data Integration

  - Verify the dashboard is showing real data from linked AWS accounts
  - Ensure all widgets are functional (cost trends, service breakdown, etc.)

  3. Cost Explorer Page

  - Check if it's fully functional with charts and filters
  - Ensure it connects to the backend cost analytics API

  4. Budgets Page

  - Verify budget creation, editing, and deletion works
  - Check if alerts are displaying properly

  5. Testing & Polish

  - End-to-end user flow testing
  - Error handling improvements
  - Loading states consistency
  - Responsive design checks

  My Recommendation

  I'd suggest we prioritize in this order:
  1. Fix the Recommendations page - It's noted as a placeholder and would add real value
  2. Test the dashboard - Make sure it displays data correctly
  3. Verify Cost Explorer - Ensure all analytics features work
  4. Polish and bug fixes - Clean up any rough edges

  What would you like to focus on next? I can:
  - Implement a fully functional Recommendations page
  - Review and enhance any of the existing pages
  - Focus on testing the complete user flow
  - Work on something else you have in mind
